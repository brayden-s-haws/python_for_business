## Description

This is a set of tools that were developed during a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/104u8E3@OPiEMAQIQBIKElVyMLgnvg1DUGVOhnjGLHP-yyY3iAxOfyf0WooAhYesXARScrTl/">Python For Business Course</a>. 
<p> </p>

- importer folder contains Python files used to read in data, analyze it, and then write it to a file. It can be used to read and write both CSV and Excel files.
- dataAnalysis folder contains Python files that were used to analyze data for an assortment of business cases. These cases related to things such as: seasonality, segmentation, bottlenecks, and roi.

<p> </p>
During the course you are given a specific set of raw data files that you must process and output. The files in the dataAnalysis folder are specific to those data files. But the code is built in such a way that it can easily be adapted to process new files that are unrelated to the course.
